# Next Steps for Uptime Monitoring App

## What's Been Implemented

1. **Database Schema**
   - Created a comprehensive Supabase schema in `supabase_schema.sql`
   - Includes tables for domains, uptime logs, SSL info, domain expiry, and alerts
   - Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies for proper data protection

2. **Admin Panel**
   - Created admin-only pages for managing domains
   - Implemented domain creation, editing, and deletion
   - Protected with middleware to allow only authorized admin access

3. **Public Dashboard**
   - Built a public dashboard displaying all monitored domains
   - Implemented search and filtering by status
   - Added real-time auto-refresh of domain statuses
   - Created detailed domain info pages with history and embed code

4. **Monitoring Logic**
   - Created utility functions for checking domain uptime
   - Implemented SSL certificate expiry checking
   - Added domain expiry monitoring using the APILayer Whois API
   - Built email alert system for notifications

5. **Status Badges and Embedding**
   - Created an API endpoint to generate SVG status badges
   - Added embedding features for websites to display status

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Execute the Database Setup**
   - Create a Supabase project
   - Run the SQL from `supabase_schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor
   - Update the admin email in the SQL view to your email

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Configure all required environment variables as outlined in the README
   - Make sure to set the ADMIN_EMAIL and APILayer key

3. **Test the Admin Functionality**
   - Create an account with the admin email
   - Test domain addition, editing, and deletion
   - Verify proper access control (non-admin users shouldn't access admin panel)

4. **Set Up Monitoring Cron Job**
   - Set up a cron job or scheduled task to hit the `/api/cron/monitor` endpoint
   - For Vercel, use Vercel Cron Jobs
   - For other hosts, set up an external cron service

5. **Test Email Alerts**
   - Configure email service (Mailgun or others)
   - Test alerts for downtime and expiry dates

## Future Enhancements to Consider

1. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Add historical uptime charts and reports
   - Show uptime percentage over time

2. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Add TCP/UDP port checking
   - Implement content validation (checking if specific text is present)
   - Add HTTP response header validation

3. **Team Collaboration**
   - Allow multiple admin users
   - Implement team workspaces
   - Add user roles (admin, viewer, etc.)

4. **Custom Notifications**
   - Add SMS notifications
   - Integrate with Slack, Discord, or other platforms
   - Customize alert thresholds per domain

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement more efficient data storage for logs
   - Add data retention policies
   - Optimize database queries for large datasets
